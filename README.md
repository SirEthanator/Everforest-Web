# Everforest Website

My unofficial website for the Everforest colorscheme.


This is my first project using NextJS and React, so don't expect 100% quality code. It's still currently being worked on at the moment so not everything will work. If anyone is willing to give feedback on absolutely anything, feel free to open an issue.

Now with that out of the way, you can visit it at: [everforest.vercel.app](https://everforest.vercel.app)


### TODO

Please note that these aren't in any particular order. They will be done when I wish to complete them.
